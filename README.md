# ASCD_Enclosure
Enclosure for Brett Watt's Arduino 8x PCB Smart Charger Discharger

For more information about Bretts design, see [https://www.vortexit.co.nz/arduino-8x-charger-discharger/](https://www.vortexit.co.nz/arduino-8x-charger-discharger/) or his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3F60pBuzm2kRsHjqQOAO9Q)

I created an enclosure for my own dual display varient of the unit, but it is compatible with the standard single display version using only the left and centre display supports.

I designed the base in two halves because my 3D printer is not large enough to print it in one piece.  The two haves fit together using dovetail slots.  If printing with material that shrinks when it cools (especially ABS) then don't forget to expand the print slightly in your slicer, otherwise the printer circuit will not fit into the receess arount the perimeter. Don't ask me how I know :-)

The enslose is designed to house a 150 x 60 x 25mm heatsink, available from the usual online stores/auction sites. The exact description on the ones I purchsed was "Aluminum Heatsink Cooling Fin 150mmx60mmx25mm for Power Amplifier N0Q6 N7X1" if that helps locate them.

Once a flat piece of material is scewed onto the base, the enclosure is designed to draw all of the air either through the fins on the heatsink or over the resisters by creating negative pressure internally.

I used a 12V blower fan described as "75mm Brushless DC 12V Blower Cooling Fan Ball Bearing 2 Pin Computer"

You will also need a bunch of brass threaded inserts that can be melted onto place using a soltering iron.
