# ASCD_Enclosure
Enclosure for Brett Watt's Arduino 8x PCB Smart Charger Discharger

For more information about Bretts design, see [https://www.vortexit.co.nz/arduino-8x-charger-discharger/](https://www.vortexit.co.nz/arduino-8x-charger-discharger/) or his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3F60pBuzm2kRsHjqQOAO9Q)

I created an enclosure for my own dual display varient of the unit, but it is compatible with the standard single display version using only the left and centre display supports.
